 1. **Valid email address**

*Register for additional services:*

The services listed below require you to request access. Don't worry if
you are undecided—you can request access now, or at any time.

-  `Atmosphere <http://www.cyverse.org/atmosphere>`__ - The CyVerse
   cloud platform where you can create custom Linux-based virtual
   machines or use existing ones (your account must be linked to an .edu
   email address to register).
-  `Bisque <http://www.cyverse.org/bisque>`__ - A platform for managing
   images and their metadata that allows you to analyze image data in
   more than 100 file formats.
-  `CoGe <https://genomevolution.org/coge/>`__ - The Comparative
   Genomics platform gives you access to thousands of genomes and a
   variety of tools for genome analysis.
-  `DNA Subway <http://www.cyverse.org/dna-subway>`__- DNA Subway makes
   high-level genome analysis broadly available to students and
   educators, and provides easy access to the types of data and
   informatics tools that drive modern biology. Using the intuitive
   metaphor of a subway map, DNA Subway organizes research-grade
   bioinformatics analysis tools into logical workflows and presents
   them in an appealing interface.

.. Tip:: 
      To register for Atmosphere or other services, login to the user portal's dashboard
